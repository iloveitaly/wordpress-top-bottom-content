Easily Add Content to the Top or Bottom of WordPress Posts
==============================================

Very simple WordPress plugin to easily put content at the top or bottom of posts.

Doesn't put this content in your feed or your regular pages.

You can use shortcodes and HTML in the content and disable the plugin with a toggle.

That's it. Enjoy.
